## Analyzing the Wind Turbine Market

We were tasked with the following scenario for a 3-day data sprint. We were provided two primary datasets, and expected to use them in conjunction with external sources to deliver our findings and present to financial stakeholders. 

Scenario - You work for WOW!, a clean energy private equity firm
based in Chicago. So far their investments have been in U.S. hydropower
and they are now thinking about investing in U.S. wind power. Your manager comes to speak with you and tells you that a team of data analysts is being formed to assess the U.S. wind turbine market on a short turnaround. The team needs to present its findings to the investment
committee in time for their quarterly investment decisions.
